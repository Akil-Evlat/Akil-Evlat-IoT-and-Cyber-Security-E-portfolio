# IOT & Cyber Security

**Purpose**: Purpose of this repo is to show all the progress is taken week by week. As you might noticed there are
folders that named with week numbers. Each week has its own assignment. You can check read me section and get more details.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/Akil-Evlat/Akil-Evlat-IoT-and-Cyber-Security-E-portfolio/tree/main/Week1-2">Week 1-2</a></h2>
<h2> First week </h2>
We start with lecture notes and cover this topics

- Cyber security: What is it and why is it important?
- Common types of attacks in Cyber security
- Cyber Security Professionals
- Research Areas
- The CIA triangle for Cyber Security
- Ethical and legal responsibilities
- Discussion â€“ Digitalisation

And then we worked on some CLI commands that is called **Scanning Activities**. It was all about checking network details with a few simple commands.
It was useful though. I learnt a lot. We had some personal questions end of the document.

## End of unit activity
Activity 1: 
Cloud platforms are becoming a very common commodity in the digital system. What are the benefits and draw backs in Cloud solutions with respect to cyber security? Present an argument with minimum 500 words in favour of or against cloud storage. What are the security risks involved in cloud vs local store . You should post your solution in the discussion group and provide at least two references.

Activity 2: 
In 2017 a ransomware termed as WannaCry unleased its malicious attack on a global scale. What cautions and safeguards should have been in place that could have averted this attack?

List the security measures you would take to safeguard your computer against attacks that are caused by legacy software without updates. Consider both scenarios where there is an option for a software update and without it. Write at least 100 words for each case.

Activity 3: 
Why is it important to have a backup system in place that works closely with cyber security framework? How are these two components are related? Please use your own personal computer as hypothetical machine and list the steps that you will adopt to backup your data.

<h2> Second Week </h2>

On week 2 we tried to answer some questions about **Digitalization** topic. We had an article and we had some questions to answer. We also had a question which was about \*_Energy Crisis_ in EU.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/Akil-Evlat/Akil-Evlat-IoT-and-Cyber-Security-E-portfolio/tree/main/Week3-4">Week 3-4</a></h2>

On week 3-4 we worked on a Cyber Kill Chain. Motivation of the week was make a small seminar about A 'Worst Nightmare' Cyberattack: The Untold Story of The SolarWinds Hack. Our titles were the following:

- Kill-Chain Phase
- Kill-Chain Phase Description
- Solar Winds Kill-Chain Phase Mapping
- Solar Winds Mitigation
- Proposed Tools

<h2><a href="https://github.com/Akil-Evlat/Akil-Evlat-IoT-and-Cyber-Security-E-portfolio/tree/main/Week4-5">Week 4-5</a></h2>

We got information about kali Linux by reading 2 articles in 4-5 weeks and we saw that it was applied in the lab. Later, we downloaded the VMware machine to our own system at home and installed virtual kali Linux on our computer.Then we created a table about analyses the solar winds exploit using the Cyber Kill Chain.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/Akil-Evlat/Akil-Evlat-IoT-and-Cyber-Security-E-portfolio/tree/main/Week5-6">Week 5-6</a></h2>

In week 5 and 6 first we complete the lecture notes, these are the main titles:

- AAA
- Threat Risk Assessment Matrix
- Kali linux and VmWare
- Tools and description

And after that in the lab section first we simulate a dos attack, second we set up a honeypot and last we implement port security.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/Akil-Evlat/Akil-Evlat-IoT-and-Cyber-Security-E-portfolio/tree/main/Week6-7">Week 6-7</a></h2>

In week 6 and 7 we finished the lecture notes first, titles are:
- Attacks on Enterprise Networks
- Man-in-the-middle attack
After that we watched a video showing exactly how it's done(<a href="https://youtu.be/p4pLVN_hVsU">Video link</a>)
 In the and I uploaded the notes I took on this subject to the week 6-7 file

 <h2><a href="https://github.com/Akil-Evlat/Akil-Evlat-IoT-and-Cyber-Security-E-portfolio/tree/main/Week8-9">Week 8-9</a></h2>

In this week we cover IOT and Phsical Computin lecture notes which is include:
- Introduction about What is physical Computing?
- Introduction about IOT 
- IOT ingredients, devices, etc.
After that we create a table to selecting an IOT infrastructure, you can see my table and notes in week8-9 file.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/Akil-Evlat/Akil-Evlat-IoT-and-Cyber-Security-E-portfolio/tree/main/Week10-11">Week 10-11</a></h2>

In the last weeks 10 and 11 first we finish our last lecture notes, these are the titles:
- Threat Modelling
- Common treath actors
- Smart Parking Garage
- The DREAD model
- Protect Cloud IoT services
- IoT Infrastructure
- Challenges

And then Babak Reihani came and gave us a small seminar about The practical aspects/challenges of IoT Operations.
In the seminar, he gave us very good information about IoT and then made an effective presentation where he shared his knowledge and experience about his company.
It was very nice that he brought us the smart home systems that he made and sold in the presentation and explained them practically.

I added the notes I took about the seminar he gave to the week 10 and 11 file, you can review my notes by entering there.
